JAVA PLAYGROUND


# workspace-spring-tool-suite-4-4.5.0.RELEASE

Multiple Spring projects and tests. 
For now I'm concentrating on building a solid API Rest model, which I'll connect to an Angular project.

As usual, I'm using my vinyl collection as a basis. What can I say, it's nice to combine passions.

So ignore all other projects and tests in this repository, because I'm not trying to polish any of those.
